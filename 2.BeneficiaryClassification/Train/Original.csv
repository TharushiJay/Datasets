0,if you catch them right your in a 4 star hotel - if not -your going to get pot luck on some services.,0
1,and travelers should avoid it if they are looking for an upmarket hotel in amsterdam.,0
2,on thing i liked was just a block away was an albert heijn grocery store for picking up an odd room snack or soda so you don't have to pay $5.00 from the mini bar.,0
3,"might be a good place for tourists, but try another place if you are in amsterdam on business.",0
4,"however, people should know that the rating in amsterdam is different.",0
5,if you want something a bit different i am sure you will find a bed and breakfast of better quality at a fraction of the price.,0
6,the cafe off the main lobby is expensive for coffee - plenty of local nice places on the 9 streets which are literally on the next block down;,0
7,"also, the hotel would be advised to forget the waffles, chocolate and water freebies and provide tea and coffee making facilities.",1
8,"if you can stay on the top floor, i highly recommend this hotel.",0
9,"i have yet to email the hotel and see what repsonse i get, however, if you do stay here i would suggest you check the bed first before opening your luggage.",0
10,i would highly recommend this hotel if you are staying in amesterdam.,0
11,one important item that is not mentioned on their website is that a trolly runs close by from the central train station.,0
12,"if you take the train from the airport(very easy), you get off at central station and catch the #2 trolly.",0
13,"ps try the all you can eat ribs at the sing singel pub, turn right when you leave the hotel and keep walking you will find the pub on the right approx 200 yds.",0
14,"in closing i would go to the other ns hotel down the road which belongs to the same group looked a lot better of the botel if you want location at a small cost, its a real rip off here",0
15,and you should visit it even if you dont stay in the hotel.,0
16,"if you don't like where you're at, ask to change.",0
17,when in the adjacent building you have to go through an alleyway so bring your coat even when going for beakfast.,0
18,and when you have to many shopping bags just pop back to hotel drop them off and back across the road for more spending.,0
19,the breakfast room is in the old winter garden which is a lovely ornate room with a very relaxed atmosphere you don't need much for lunch after that.,0
20,and curtains could do with a splash of colour.,1
21,i recommend you keep wandering right past them to the pulitzer or the dylan.,0
22,"however there are plenty of hotels around there, which would certainly do more in every aspect than only acclaiming its history, reputation and services on pamphlets.",0
23,but if you are expecting a mid range 4 star or high end 3 star then this is your place.,0
24,make sure you take your bike!,0
25,the public areas are those you would expect from a 2-3 star hotel - all again in need of a major updating.,1
26,"if you get to go there, have a look at the canopy outside the main entrance, its patched up with sellotape!!",0
27,"less than 10 minute walk from central station,many restaurants within walking distance,and always a lot going on right outside in dam square to people watch.",0
28,"when you check-in, be aware that if you are given a room in the back of the hotel, reachable through elevator #5, you are going to have a terrible experience.",0
29,"if you don't want to spend that much, there are a few places that sell bread, croissants and rolls just a few meters from the hotel (especially on damrak).",0
30,"otherwise the department store that is just outside the hotel (on the right, looking at the royal palace) has a nice cafeteria.",0
31,a short walk to the front gets you to the leidse square,0
32,if you want anything else you have to go there now and take it from the buffet.,0
33,"the comforter, drapes and furniture were in need of replacement.",1
34,the city centre is a short walk away along a pedestrianised street or you can take a tram.,0
35,and if you have booked i would strongly recommend that you check your bill carefully when checking out and don't choose the express checkout option.,0
36,do not let the online travel sites fool you.,0
37,"also when asking for a wake-up call, be aware that it won't be a call",0
38,don't even waste your time arguing with the administration.,0
39,"we didn't eat at all in the hotel, but in a nice italian restaurant (if you stand facing the hotel, turn right and you'll find it up a side street).",0
40,"if you turn left when exiting the hotel you can expect to find a prettier, quieter, more picturesque side of amsterdam with nicer cafes, bars and restaurants offering more reasonable prices for better food and drink.",0
41,guests should know all of these facts before choosing to book this hotel.,0
42,if you can get past the receptionists and get the room you booked i think you will be hard pushed to find fault with this hotel.,0
43,the carpets and furniture are in need of renewal.,1
44,however there are plenty of other places within walking distance which offer cheaper alternatives.,0
45,ask at the front desk for the coupon and they will be happy to give you this.,0
46,"if you are looking for the convenience of this hotel's location across from the train station, be aware that this is a particularly seedy, dangerous area.",0
47,"if you want to me near the station but in a safer, better hotel, you should definitely pay a little more to stay at the renaissance about 1 block away.",0
48,and i would not recommend a stay in this hotel.,0
49,"the hotels location was great especially when you are arriving via train, just oppsite the train station and at the start of damark street.",0
50,i'd recommend that you avoid it altogether and get it in a local cafe.,0
51,and really touristy squares to feel really relaxed (although there is a sqaure with all this only a block away if you want it).,0
52,"word of note, if you want the mini bar restocked, make sure you let the cleaners know you want your room cleaned/drinks restocked!",0
53,would highly recommend and will be staying there again for definite.,0
54,and you should definitely go to the dutch restaurant they recommend round the corner.,0
55,but you can always specify which you prefer when you book.,0
56,with everything being complimentary from the breakfast to the drinks we can not recommend this hotel highly enough.,0
57,"the breakfastbuffet was comprehensive, and could be supplemented by made-to-order eggs, pancakes, omelets, or french toast.",1
58,"do yourself a favor and have an indonesian dinner at tempo doeloe, utrechtestraat 75. try a rice platter which includes portions of 18 different dishes.",0
59,"yes they are if you want to drink cheap cava, cheap white wine and cheap red wine.",0
60,"be sure to meet kevin at the front desk, he knows just about everything concerning your stay in ams.",0
61,dont let the expensive prices dupe you into thinking you will be staying at a deluxe hotel it is  re assuringly expensive the staff are few and far between.,0
62,"you might not get the same high class amenities that are offered in some of the bigger chains, but if you want to stay somewhere that makes you feel at home from the moment that you walk in the door,",0
63,"the room was small, and a little noisy (it was at the front of the hotel next to the main road), if you get a chance ask for a room with a canal view as it will be on the side of the hotel where there's less traffic.",0
64,"if you plan on sitting in your room for most of your stay while in amsterdam then stay elsewhere, but if you want a good, clean hotel to be used as a place to sleep/base while exploring the city then you can't go wrong with the nadia.",0
65,but a deposit gives you that piece of mind (just a suggestion).,0
66,"one place you must visit is the ice bar - 15 euros and includes a drink,",0
67,if you have spare time go on the half day trip to the windmills of zaanse sans and then onto the cheese factory (don't buy the cheese - if you really want some its half price at airport) and then to fishing village of volendam.,0
68,"the hotel was run by friendly staff and the rooms where cleaned daily, rooms where reasonably priced and comfortable, if your considering stopping then you have no worries that you will be dissapointed.",0
69,the hotel is ideally located with a great view of westerkirk church and within easy walking distance to some worthwhile stops such as the anne frank house  the theater museum.,0
70,"for the price, i would definitely stay there again, but recommend a room without a view, as they are quieter.",0
71,"if you're on a budget, this place is fine.",0
72,before considering the hotel nadia you must consider amsterdam as a whole.,0
73,if you are deciding on which hotel to stay at and are concerned about the size or layout of the hotel then you simply must realise that this is amsterdam,0
74,there are also some lovely boutique shops two minutes away along the canal.,0
75,if you are looking for a flashy sterile five star hotel then this probably isn't the place for you.,0
76,would recommend a stay at the nadia for anyone travelling to amsterdam.,0
77,"good clothes shopping to be done in kalverstraat & nieuwendijk, just off the dam square and there is a good tattoo artist in gravenstraat too ;) .",0
78,"if you are a miffy fan (called 'nintje' in holland, and created there) take the no. 5 tram to the miffy shop (called de winkel van nijntje) at beethovenstraat.",0
79,if you are travelling alone - please don't stay at this hotel.,0
80,"if you sleep lightly, this would be a problem because of all the trams that go by - so ask for an interior room.",0
81,and older travellers ought to beware of the extremely steep steps that lead up to the reception and rooms.,0
82,"you would be right next to shopping areas, canal tours, madamme tussauds, close to red light district and anne frank house.",0
83,there is a very nice take away sandwich shop near by.,0
84,"for business use, it was fine (and there's a free computer room for guests on the 1st floor), but if you're there for tourism you might want something with some character.",0
85,"rooms have everything you could want; there's free internet access, which is useful if you want info on local attractions, train times, etc  free 'phone calls - again useful to confirm local arrangements.",0
86,a great place to stay especially if you want quick access to the rijks and/or van gogh museums.,0
87,"the pub the ""last waterhole"" is a great spot if you want to hear live bands & theres lots of different places to eat - hotel v staff were very friendly and helpful,",0
88,and if you go to a supermarket on the ramblas called carrefour you can stock up on the same brand of water the hotel puts in the minibar.,0
89,and beware of the packages you purchase.,0
90,but unless your can swim in 2 inches of water dont expect to go too deep in the roof top pool,0
91,we recommend this hotel for people looking for a good 5 stars hotel in the center of barcelona.,0
92,"if you want only a location then this hotel is your best bet in barcelona for a shopping and walking around location, it's in the middle of all the main shops and restaurants....",0
93,there is a coffee/pastry house just across the street.,0
94,"having had a look at the better rooms, i would suggest only staying here if you were prepared to pay the extra for an upgraded room.",0
95,"if you want good service and a good all round experience, stay elsewhere.",0
96,"quality breakfast with good choice of food (if you're after a full-english breakfast, don't eat here).",0
97,"if you're looking for a central hotel with that special something, then i recommend the majestic.",0
98,"and (if the weather is good), the rooftop terrace is a great addition (although the pool is probably better for kids to splash in rather than trying to actually swim in).",0
99,"if you are trying to decide between the claris and the majestic, i would definitely recommend the claris.",0
100,preview your room if you must stay!,0
101,"please refrain from using your renovation as an excuse for doing such a lousy job and consider lowering your rating for what it's worth, 2* maybe 3 and nothing more.",1
102,"please, whatever you do, spend your money elsewhere.",0
103,"my summary - despite its wonderful location, the facilities of this hotel represent vary poor value for money (suggest you try the hotel des arts) - by no stretch of the imagination do they equate to five star.",0
104,be prepared to pay 4 euro for an in-room coffee made yourself by the coffeemaker in the room (and then add the tax to it) or 7 euro for a coke taken from you minibar (again without the tax).,0
105,"and it would be highly suggested to get out and look at some leading places such as : malmaison, hotel du vin and sofitel, which yes do charge your sort of high prices, but do deliver an exceptional service,",0
106,"or you can stroll to las ramblas in 30 minutes, mostly along the beach.",0
107,"if they could improve the service, this would be a top hotel even on a world-level standard.",1
108, beware of the many pickpockets in the area,0
109,"the hotel is near the marina, which is great if you want to be near the beach, but is not in the centre of things...",0
110,and you can buy glorious fresh produce from the market and not pay for city priced meals at or around the hotel.,0
111,in-room tea and coffee facilities would be a bonus..,1
112,"if you like to iron your clothes before an evening out, take a travel iron as the hotel does not have one you can use.",0
113,also take a travel kettle as the rooms do not have tea/coffee making facilities.,0
114,use the aerobus to and from the airport - cheaper and less hassle that the metro.,0
115,"tho some rooms don't necessarily have a view, so ask for one at the front of the building (but this will be noisier if you leave the windows open).",0
116,if you like art nouveau this is the place for you.,0
117,"overall not a bad hotel, smart, clean and helpful staff, if you do stay here be sure to lock everything in the safe!",0
118,one for you and the hotel keep the other and these are big enough for a laptop - i would recommend using them and not leaving anything lying around.,0
119,"go one stop to drassanes and you'll find yourself down by the port and mare magnum shopping centre, where there's plenty of restaurants on offer.",0
120,plenty to see and do and for a reasonable price if you plan wisely.,0
121,there's plenty of websites with constantly changing deals on hotels (we booked through hotels.com) plus flights with easyjet lower your overall cost too (we got return flights for ____90 each).,0
122,it is overly expensive unless you stay off the main strip,0
123,"if your sleep is important to you, we would not recommend this hotel.",0
124,"if you do go, and we won't be going back, please be very careful.",0
125,so you must keep the windows closed.,0
126,"if you make an online reservation, it is impossible to mention that you travel with children.",0
127,"take the advice of having breakfast at the hotel to the left... much better, a quarter of the price and a nice atmosphere.",0
128,"if we return to barcelona, we will definitely stay at hotel barcelona universal again and would highly recommend it to anyone.",0
129,there is a free office facility on the 9th floor (2 pcs and printers) which might prove handy to you.,0
130,"a bit noisy if you have a street-side room, but with the windows closed the noise is well insulated.",0
131,"and a word to the wise: if any restaurant has pictures of the food outside, keep well away.",0
132,"we wouldn't go back there or recommend it because it simply was just average,",0
133,"there is a very nice business center on the 9th floor where you can do your flight check ins,",0
134,"the metro stop is close at hand as well, handy for visiting all the spots.",0
135,you need to read this if you are thinking of staying at this hotel.,0
136,and any other business owner would agree that some sort of action should be taken by the owner of this hotel for his guests.,1
137,also remember to bring your own travel iron as the hotel does not have one.,0
138,"if you're looking for a nice, clean hotel, this is not the one for you!",0
139,"for a great light meal,breakfast or lunch, it was great to wander down to the large market and get beautiful large fresh strawberries and wonderful pastries from the vendors.",0
140,"that being said, do stay here, but make sure that if you do, as you look at the hotel from the front, only stay on the left hand side looking onto the city rather than the harbour,",0
141,"not recommended to people with a back, good hearing or thoughs who wish to wash beyond that it is a very nice expencive and convenient hotel in which to stay.",0
142,"but unless you're boarding a cruise ship, or maybe if it's the middle of summer; i'd choose differently.",0
143,a relaxing and very friendly bar lounge and a roof top area that would be great in summer - just a little cool in the december sunshine.,0
144,"just be aware it is a big tourist city and keep your wits about you - don't flaunt money or cameras, etc..",0
145,"but if you just accept this as some city quirk and let it go over your head,",0
146,"one tip - check your change, as many waiters and taxi drivers decide what tip you are giving before you have thought about it and take it upfront !!",0
147,"if you want to drink bottled water, take in your own.",0
148,"great for travelers arriving by train, just a short walk across the plaza, but also good for those arriving by car from southern points as you just have to turn right off of diagonal onto numancia and go down a few blocks.",0
149,"this is a large, contemporary hotel, so if you are looking for quaint, typically spanish style, you might try elsewhere.",0
150,"regarding security, if you are sensible barcelona is no more dangerous than london, manchester, leeds etc. i wear rohan or meyer trousers both of which have zipped security pockets inside a front pocket, where i keep some money for the day.",0
151,for the price and area they should include breakfast at least.,1
152,if you want good food go to the attic near the top end of the ramblers.,0
153,"if you're looking for a great meal out in a modern, chic setting, this is the place for you.",0
154,"if you fancy a stroll, you can be at la rambla in 30 minutes.",0
155,no real pool so wouldnt recommend the hotel for a family with small children if a swimming pool is a necessity.,0
156,it also made a bit of noise so if you're a light sleeper you may fine your sleep disturbed.,0
157,ask for a room on as high a floor as possible as you will get great views of the city and surrounding area.,0
158,otherwise just go up between meals and get a few snaps if you want them.,0
159,"if you want go this hotel, don`t leave your money out of your sight!",0
160,but if you have any trouble with your sleep think what i just wrote above.,0
161,"would recommend the pulitzer hotel to any-one going to barcelona,go on book it now!",0
162,"in summary, if style is all you need, great -- but there are better options that are just as cool.",0
163,"anyway, please don't let this put you off this very good hotel.",0
164,but get a room above the fourth floor!!,0
165,"the property is an easy walk to passeig de gracia, la ramblas, and even the beach is not a difficult hike.",0
166,the only warning to people generally about barcelona is that the shopping is incredibly good - perhaps amongst the best shopping cities in the world - so beware the smoking credit card!,0
167,you need to stay in the gotica area away from la ramblas.,0
168,try and get a higher floor.,0
169,so be sure to bring your own adapters.,0
170,"while you are there, stop at farggi's and have a gelato, it's really good.",0
171,"and materials you can see it's all cheap decor (doorframe is a plastic material), but if that crap doesn't matter to you it should be no problem.",0
172,"pool is great for a midday break between trips around the city, with great views and lots of sun chairs,",0
173,"not too much to say which has not already been said, nice, clean and very enjoyable stay, would recommend this hotel very good location and service spot on.",0
174,"other travel tips:sagrada familia: take the elevator with the shorter line, to the right of the entrance (easy to miss this one bec you get swept into the church with the rest of the crowds to the opposite elevator).",0
175,go between 6 and 7pm when the crowds have thinned.,0
176,but you may tell him to stop serving or your bill will surprise you.,0
177,we would recommend a taxi from the airport for a 'no fuss/bother' way to reach the hotel.,0
178,and el raco restaurant is also recommended (turn right at the front door).,0
179,ask for a room on a higher floor but don't worry if you don't get it.,0
180,there are also other/ better hotel options than this one in the area.,0
181,would recommend breakfast/drinks at the bar opposite (d'or) as reasonably priced and very friendly staff.,0
182,would recommend a visit to the hotel roof - pool looked inviting and plenty of sun loungers.,0
183,"would definitely recommend you see the following: sagrada familia, casa batillo, la pedera and pablo espanlo.",0
184,give yourself plenty of time to see each as you will be suprised by the amount of time spent in each.,0
185,"downside: shower needs longer barrier (taking a shower means creating a small flood), need more soap for 2 people, haphazard replenishment of toiletries.",0
186,"do visit the gaudi houses - casa batllo is stunning,",0
187,be warned though - the last half of that is up a steep slope.,0
188,if you're a student take your nus card to get discounts on entrance fees.,0
189,visit the boqueria market just off las ramblas - the fruit and veg in particular is an amazing sight.,0
190,if you have been to barcelona and know how to get around-this is a great hotel.,0
191,i would suggest that you take some ear plugs if you intend staying here!,0
192,"the breakfast buffet has a diverse range, and is good value if included in your booking.",0
193,and it's just a short walk round to la rambla and a couple of blocks down on the right you'll find the hotel.,0
194,there is also a starbucks attached to the hotel if you just fancy a coffee and a muffin one morning.,0
195,"so, either make sure you give youself plenty of time to graze or head out to one of the coffee bars in the area to grab a coffee  pastry.",0
196,"if you're looking for a great - and cheap - seafood restaurant, then try la paradeta on c/comercial 7 about a 15 minute walk from the hotel.",0
197,"choose from glistening mounds of clams, mussels, squid, spider crabs and whatever else the boats have brought in, let them know how you'd like it cooked (grilled, steamed or a la marinera), pick a sauce, buy a drink and wait for your number to be called.",0
198,but don't ask the staff for tips or advice and make sure they don't put you into one of the small and dark corner rooms on the inner courtyard.,0
199,and there are plenty of cafes nearby - there's a starbucks next door for those craving a caffeine fix and a number of small supermercados nearby for picking up water/drinks for cheaper than the mini bar.,0
200,"please check out my pics, so you can see what the rooms look like.",0
201,"if you want to stay here make sure you pay the extra supplements for the ""good"" rooms.",0
202,and you have to hold down the button continually to keep the dryer on.,0
203,"the breakfast was excellent, but try and track down a bb rate.",0
204,just walk 5 yards onto ramblas and hail one - never took me longer than 30 seconds.,0
205,and i would recommend taking the time to enjoy a leisurely breakfast in the dining room which over looks the rambalas.,0
206,"however if your looking to relax and get a decent sleep, be careful as we didnt !",0
207,the patagonia is definitely worth a visit - beef to die for!,0
208,i would recommend asking for a room with a window to the outside.,0
209,"in relation to placa de catalunya and la rambla the hotel is less than 5 minutes walk to each, plus there's a tourist information office just another couple minutes walk on la rambla.",0
210,- there was some street noise in our room on the second floor - people during the night and traffic (seemed to be a lot of trucks loading and unloading) during the day so earplugs are recommended if you're a light sleeper; and - the lifts take an age to a,0
211,"but overall i'd recommend this to travellers, especially younger travellers who like somewhere more upmarket than the hostels who might appreciate the modernity and basic aesthetic of the place.",0
212,if you want to be hunkered down in a bubble - where no one bothers you and you don't care about the true parisien lifestyle - sure - stay here.,0
213,"pleasant staff, pleasant public rooms, pleasant breakfast but if you stay here do not stay in a standard double room-- either stay in a superior room or suite or go to another hotel.",0

215,"do check out a gem of a restaurant called la carre around the corenr from the hotel, delightful good and friendly service.",0
216,there is only one desk attendant at any one time - so don't expect a porter to help with luggage (they don't offer either).,0
217,"skip the breakfast, the bakery right downstairs is great - it opens at 7am though.",0
218,i don't think it would be worth paying for a bigger corner room as you'll want to be out all day visiting paris.,0
219,"but there are many other hotels nearby, and if you make your reservation well in advance (which we didn't do),",0
220,you can have plenty of choice and definitely pick a better option.,0
221,i would also print of a detailed map of the location.,0
222,subway is very easy to use  2 euro for each ride or less if you buy a carnat of 10 tickets.,0
223,there are a number of reasonably priced restaurants on place du marche saint-honore which is only a couple of short blocks from the hotel.,0
224,and that is one of the rooms is located next to a very busy restaurant / bar (room 115) avoid this room or bring sleeping tablets.,0
225,i would suggest another hotel if you want to sleep past 7:00.,0
226,"right around the corner, about a five minute walk away, is a wonderful boulangerie, cheese shop, green grocer, wine shop and bistro.",0
227,you can easily walk to notre dame or the pantheon from this hotel.,0
228,there are loads of cafes which offer breakfast at the same price as the hotel in the area.,0

230,store in the fridge and have what youy want instead of the standard fare.,0
231,there is a fresh food market at the maubert-mutualit____ metro stop three times a week.,0
232,"but if the main woman isn't at the front desk, forget about helpful dinner directions.",0
233,"this hotel is a good basic choice if you you just want a clean, safe place from which to visit the sites.",0
234,if you want a fancy lobby and lounge it's a 5-10 minute walk to the ritz or the westin.,0
235,in front of the hotel there is an excellent japanesse restaurant which seems to be a major hit with the locals.,0
236,you have all of paris to explore (bring good walking shoes!).,0
237,"a fantastic caf____/boulanger down the street (ronde du pains), the eiffel tower about a 5-10 minute walk.",0
238,"so, if you think that you're going to get one of the good ones for certain just because you book a superior room, don't count on it!",0
239,"having gone through the experience, although i never would have imagined saying it, i would recommend staying at a cookie-cutter, boring ibis for a comparable or cheaper rate.",0
240,"if you don't mind some discomfort, this is the right hotel for you.",0
241,and my god you had better stock up on juice,0
242,the nearest pharmacy is a train ride away - beware.,0
243,if you want peace and quiet then this is the place for you -,0
244,keep in mind that the walls at this hotel are very thin.,1
245,"here's a tip: take the metro to the station notre dame de lorette, and the hotel is immediately up the street and around the corner.",0
246,just search for the station on any of the maps in the metro stations.,0
247,"if you are looking for a great meal on the go at an inexpensive price, try a restaurant called brioche doree.",0
248,there is a supermarket over the road so take your kettle so you can have coffee in your room.,0
249,use the supermarche across the street for snacks and sodas.,0
250,"also, they are renovating the metro stop closest to the eiffel until next march, so walking is a nicer option.",0
251,"if you are staying in this hotel, do not stay in section c facing the back of the hotel!!!",0
252,"for a cheaper breakfast, right on the corner of sutter street there is a diner where classic american breakfast is served.",0
253,i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that was traveling to san francisco (and especially if they're looking to shop!).,0
254,"so, don't just look at the ranking, make sure you are staying at a motel, not a hotel.",0
255,one tip though.... it can be better to go the end of the line/terminus to get a car and join the queue as some are very busy,0
256,one suggestion to the hotel - sounds like being turned away for not having a room available has happened frequently in the past.,1
257,this is not the place to stay if you are on a romatice getaway.,0
258,and you can get up early and walk all the way to the golden gate bridge.,0
259,don't make the same mistake i did.,0
260,there is an abundance of restaurants/cafes/shops etc. definately try the fresh crab from anywhere on fishermans grotto and the fresh clam chowder in a bread bowl from the boudin bakery.,0
261,do a wine country tour it is good to get out of sf and have a few!,0
262,don't miss the complimentary wine tasting at 5pm every day - great way to meet other travellers and enjoy a glass or two.,0
263,"if you want to see the golden gate bridge, you can rent bikes or two seater and four seater motorized vehicles from a few places within two or three blocks of the hotel.",0
264,we also recommend polker's for breakfast.,0
265,"nice bar two blocks east, great breakfast one block west on van ness where you pay for a great egg/bacon sandwhich.",0
266,"if you have a car, you can park here, which is a real bonus in a city where parking is limited.",0
267,if i was to give a couple of tips for staying in san francisco they would be avoid fishermans wharf unless you like really touristy trash,0
268,what a great city --wear comfortable shoes!!!,0
269,overall i would not recommend.,0
270,"if you don't read up on it ahead of time, there is a channel on the tv with info about the hotel.",0
271,if you want to impress your cab driver - go with the st.,0
272,if you need to be directly across the street from union square and can't walk even one block (and why you would go to sf if that were the case) - go with the st.,0
273,"if you are willing to take the risk and leave your car with this hotel, be prepared to wait 15 minutes for them to retrieve the car.",0
274,don't bother paying for brekkie unless you really want to pig out at the buffet.,0
275,they need to watch those food temperatures,1
276,i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.,0
277,"so if you have expectations of having a spa in the winter at this marriott, forget it!",0
278,i'd probably start booking for a hotel much earlier and chosen a different hotel.,0
279,overall i recommend this hotel.,0
280,"there's a little store in front of the hotel where you can get some goodies and snacks and bring them back to your hotel and use the mini fridge to store soda, water, etc. and should help save money from having to use the mini-bar stuff.",0
281,"food prices at the hotel restaurant can be steep (but so are most restaurants at any hotel for that matter)tips: eat breakfast at a deli nearby the hotel, cheaper!",0
282,"also, take a trip to manly beach if you have time,",0
283,an early arrival is always fraught with problems (one has little choice about when to arrive due to airline schedules).,0
284,"if you don't mind climbing up a small slope, try the shangri-la.",0
285,as an insider tip ... walk all the way across the bridge and then underneath for great photo ops of the city ...,0
286,"also had room service- quick and again, reasonable.",0
287,you shouldn't be in sydney to sit in your room and watch tv.,0
288,"and for that the hotel scores great marks, however when staying in a hotel i would expect to be pampered or at the very least not longing to return to my own bed.",0
289,"make sure you are aware of this, and plan your last day accordingly.",0
290,whatever you do don't book the rooms with 2 single beds if you are an adult!,0
291,take a 10 dollar taxi ride to the sydney harbour area or to downtown and you will get your fill of restaurants.,0
292,however if you get the price right and want clean,0
293,i would recommend the altamont to the independent traveller.,0
294,my one suggestion for improvement would be that breakfast could be more imaginative and varied.,0
295,a hotel that wants to atrract a fashionable young crowd must surely think that a full length mirror in all bedrooms is a must.,0
296,you'd be better off going out on the town and finding breakfast at a cafe or restaurant.,0
297,i would recommend staying on the club floors if you choose this hotel.,0
298,i would stay there again but would make sure i was on the top floor.,0
299,"and staff quality i would advise you to go to one of the better know chain hotels, at least you know what to expect.",0
300,other things to know: the large revolving front door is locked after midnight at some point - you need to press the green lighted button on the bellstand which then rings the night manager inside to let you in;,0
301,concierge desk has plenty of umbrellas at their desk if you need to borrow one; lighting inside the rooms seemed a bit sparse if you like it bright;,0
302,certainly avoid the rooms at the back if you can,0
303,we highly recommend the estherea.,0
304,"however, watch out for the bedbugs.",0
305,if you are thinking of visiting amsterdam please do not look anywhere else!,0
306,(there's a very nice cafe next door with a huge breakfast for less than half that.,0
307," i suppose what you are paying for is the hotel's dam square location, but considering how easy it is to get around in amsterdam, and considering how noisy and dirty the dam is, why not stay some place a little further away and just walk over?",0
308,"also, if you arrive in amsterdam by car, be prepared to spend an arm",0
309,the lobby could use a little work as well.,1
310,there are plenty of restaurants nearby including the hard rock cafe just across the canal.,0
311,and if you get lost around amsterdam at least you only have to follow the signs back to central station!!,0
312,i can recommend the cocktails in the front bar.,0
313,"plus there are many better things to spend your money on in amsterdam, enjoy!",0
314,"would recommend the ice bar too to any future visitors, tho it was smaller than we thought,",0
315,please be aware though there was no indication that breakfast was not included,1
316,the great thing about this hotel is it is directly opposite central station which is a huge plus point if you are passing through with heavy bags or are coming from the airport.,0
317,so if you are taking a car expect to pay in the region of 40 euros for 24hr parking.,0
318,would recommend this hotel although for its location.,0
319,the usual taxi service from the hotel to the airport was 48e so if your trying to budget it might be better to take the tram/train route.,0
320,"if you have a 5 star reservation in any hotel in amsterdam, cancel it!",0
321,"if you have traveled europe, you know baths are not large.",0
322,get off after the floating flower market (fourth stop from central station.,0
323,i always think you shouldn't judge a book by it's cover though.,0
324,please be advised that there are steep stairs leading in to this hotel so it would not be suitable for anyone with walking difficulties,1
325,"breakfast not overly exciting, but there is a great pancake shop below the hotel which i would recommend.",0
326,"if you don't have alot of stamina, skip this place.",0
327,get your strip of tram tickets at a newsagent as pricey on the trams themselves.,0
328,(you have an hour to get back on any tram if you want to use the same just-stamped ticket.).,0
329,the anne frank house is round the corner (go late to avoid queues),0
330,would highly recommend hotel nadia and would definately stay again if visiting amsterdam in the future.,0
331,though you can always sleep with earplugs.,0
332,"you just want a base from which to explore this beautiful city,",0
333,there is a train from central station that will take you straight to the airport for a few euro.,0
334,and expect to hear noises from most of the rooms - unless you specifically ask for a quiet one!,0
335,"would not recommend this hotel, definately not worth the money, avoidlike the plague.",0
336,just don't expect any views out the window.,0
337,"we would highly recommend the hotel and its hosts for any travelers,",0
338,the tram will deposit you within one block of the hotel (at the stop just opposite the van gogh museum).,0
339,"the bathroom was large, with a shower and bathtub (and rubber duck!) you can buy tickets to the rembrandt museum and rijksmuseum through the hotel.",0
340,"if you choose a smaller room, hans will store your luggage.",0
341,a chair would be useful for longer than one night stays.,0
342,you have got to try this place when in amsterdam!,0
343,you can catch a tram from outside the hotel to all areas.,0
344,they should simply put whirlpool jets in it and accept the fact that it is nothing more than a big bathtub.,1
345,"i would recommend costa gallega, one block north on the passeig de gracia (get the piquillo peppers stuffed with crabmeat, patatas bravas, and wash down with a good cold glass of the local penedes wine - vina sol.",0
346,mattress in need of replacement or rotation - i felt i would slide off the bed because the mattress leaned towards the telephone.,1
347,"suggestion: if you insist on staying, view your room beforehand!!",0
348,i am avoiding all ritz carltons for the next century and suggest you stay away from this monstrosity in barcelona.,0
349,"one block walk takes you to the metro, and from there, you are minutes away from everything,",0
350,remember to take id if you go to the casino next doorits a real shame that we had the problems that we did otherwise probably couldn't fault the hotel,0
351,"i wouldn't normally write reviews, however after having such a stay at the weekend i feel compelled to recommend to others not to waste their money and stay at this hotel.",0
352,stay somewhere else in barcelona ... and go to the arts to visit the great bar and the fantastic arola restaurant,0
353,this hotel has a great location if you want to do the whole tourist thing around the ramblas.,0
354,there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room which should really be standard in a 4 star hotel.,1
355,"if you are still tempted to visit, stay in a hotel off the las ramblas as i think you will get a much better deal.",0
356,"it's a great place for young, old, single and couples, however put on your streetwise hat, because there are hustlers working the ramblas",0
357,"the breakfast doesn't really rise above standard eurofare, though if you just need some fuel for the day ahead it'll do.",0
358,do not hesitate in making a reservation at this place...,0
359,a 5/10 minute walk from the terminal along a signposted route brings you to the train station where a journey of 20 mins costing eur2.,0
360,"over, i would recommend this as a place to stay if visiting this great city.",0
361,be sure to lock up your stuff!!!,0
362,and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.,0
363,"but for a 5-star luxury hotel, it would be nice if they would drop off a bottle of water every day.",1
364,"i would consider staying here again, and would recommend it if you don't mind the location, but would probably stay closer to all the action next time.",0
365,"i suggest you try this place for yourself,",0
366,"if you are not spanish, then don't even think about staying here (unless you enjoy feeling like an unwelcome guest).",0
367,there is a lot to see so get a cheap guide book and plan your visit.,0
368,"if i could give you one piece of advice -- either pay more for a hotel closer to where you will actually be doing things, or come back at another time.",0
369,"if you want to get around the sights, use the bus touristico it's great.",0
370,and we highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city.,0
371,in other words make sure you ck your bill before leaving the hotel.,0
372,"and if you have a skateboarder in the party (as we did) it is very convenient for several of the better spots (macba, universitat, one stop on metro to paral.",0
373,do not recommend that you buy drinks in the hotel bar or from the mini bar - very expensive.,0
374,entry to all discounted if you buy a barcelona turistica bus ticket.,0
375,bring comfy walking shoes!,0
376,"if you are new to the area, i would not recommend it.",0
377,spa really need to be cleaned (avoid the hammam).,1
378,"i would recommend hotel 1898 as a great place to stay, especially for the wonderful rooftop terrace and the central location",0
379,"if you're a very light sleeper, go for internal room.",0
380,"antoni, a wonderful place to spend an hour (or more) if you are at all interested in local food, culture, language, etc. the metro is a block away, cabs are available on call or on the street (within a minute or two, but spotty).",0
381,"avoid the spa area which is a joke,",0
382,"nice hotel, but don't stay here unless you don't care not to receive your faxes in time, or if telephones are transfered to the wrong room (if you are the unlucky one to have the same family name as another guest...) better stay at the plaza athenee or meurice!",0
383,"try the ice-bar if you are visiting,",0
384,"make sure you re-finance your home, sell your car and bring lots of cash for the many employees who are grateful for their $20 tips all day.",0
385,"skip the 15 euro breakfast and walk out of the hotel, turn left, walk 15 steps and you are at a wonderful bakery!",0
386,you could have got here by a combination of the roissy bus and metro 8,0
387,"and about twice a week, there is a farmer's market here where you can buy everything from fresh fish and foie gras to table linens and jewelry.",0
388,don't expect to go to sleep any time prior to 2am because the radiator pipes will keep you awake.,0
389,i would suggest that hotel langlois paint  furnish the attic so that it measures up to the rest of their facility.,1
390,"think hard before booking this hotel - the room rate might seem ok,",0
391,"i would love to go back and would definitely recommend it for the ambience, fantastic location, totally amazing staff and all the special treats!",0
392,we were thrilled to be upgraded to the suite on the ground floor - check out the photos on the hotel website - all true!,0
393,grab a couple bakery items at one of the corner bakeries and have a seat at the counter of the cafe bleu for a morning cafe au lait.,0
394,"though, we do recommend this hotel to others.",0
395,"there is a boulanger a few doors up if you decided to buy croissants, baguettes, eclairs etc and the metro is literally right outside.",0
396,"however, do not accept rooms 701 or 702 if you are a light sleeper (like me.) the rooms are on the ground floor, off the courtyard.",0
397,we left half the box on the table,0
398,"my advice is book a hotel in an area with more charm, unless you want to be downtown,",0
399,room needs better electricity plugs,1
400,"a tip - if you want a really quiet room, ask for one at the back of the hotel above floor 10. we took breakfast every morning in the hotel's restaurant, luques.",0
401,"if you are sharing a room with someone you do not know, get two rooms.",0
402,ask for a room in the back of the hotel or high up.,0
403,"If you do end up here, be sure to specify a room at the back of the hotel.",0
404,and I was woken by the early morning firing up of the local bus service (a courtyard-facing room is essential unless you have industrial strength earplugs.)The rooms are small and ill-conceived.,0
405,"As a general tip, if you need to use the internet whilst in Berlin, look up the Easy Internet cafes before you go, there's a huge one in Kurfurstendam",0
406,"If you expect no more than that, you won't be disappointed.",0
407,"Room was big, bath was lovely, but watch out for the tile floor after you shower.",1
408,Desk staff needs to go to a Waldorf class on manners.,1
409,Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned.,1
410,"Don't eat breakfast in the restaurant, too costly.",0
411,"Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros..",0
412,Look around the same area for another hotel.,0
413,"With the highest breakfast prices we've ever seen, it would have been nice to have in-room beverage stations/coffee makers like one usually finds in Westins.",1
414,"If you're looking for that famous Berlin nightlife, look elsewhere.",0
415,Avoid these rooms - it is very clear why they do not have a photograph of them on their web site.,0
416,Even with these benefits I would not recommend staying in this hotel.,0
417,Rooms needed upgrading badly (and our view was of the roof!) and a good clean!,1
418,"If you have the chance, go for the brand new Radisson, Hyatt, Marriott or Adlon.",0
419,"If you get a great rate per night, like I did using a voucher system, is OK, but otherwise stay elsewhere.",0
420,Dont go for the pictures on the starwood internet site.,0
421,My take on it is that the sewer system put in by the GDR needs to be replaced.,1
422,"Bottom line: pick another hotel, the Starwood Group has a white elephant on their hands with this smelly grand hotel.",0
423,so I really highly recommend.,0
424,Hilton - stay on executive floor (great lounge) get a room overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt (beautiful day and night).,0
425,"Anyone looking for something a little bit special should look elsewhere,",0
426,You may be well advised to try another address...,0
427,"Another comfortable chair in the room, there's one, would be a plus We only ate one breakfast here because we slept in, but its a bit expensive.",1
428,but most bathrooms are in urgent need of remodelling (the existing ones are dating back to the 60s!).,1
429,it is better to avoid the bar.,0
430,They do serve drinks upon request in the lobby and you better ask them to do so.,0
431,but a bit pricey 19euros since you can have a decent breakfest in any Kaffee in Berlin.,0
432,I do recommand Kaffee Einstein.,0
433,"If you're a non-smoker, don't stay here!",0
434,The rooms need a re-do.,1
435,You must use these or risk breaking your leg.,0
436,YOu do have to shop around on the newt to get best deal.,0
437,Definitely avoid travelling by Easyjet at weekend late evenings!,0
438,One more thing- if you want to visit the Bundestag it is a good idea to book a tour (in english) in advance.,0
439,Stayed here for a conference and would not advise it for people with other options.,0
440,"The location is okay for but for better restaurants and sight-seeing, stay closer to Postdamer Platz or Mitte.",0
441,If you go to this hotel don`t book a standard room.,0
442,but the bathroom was tired and in need of refurbishment.,1
443,I would not recommend this hotel.,0
444,"Whilst the room was indeed large, clean and functional it lacked the finishing touches that one expects from 5-star accommodation.",1
445,"The Restaurants in the hotel are okay, though if not eating in the hotel I would advise you to look further a field as the restaurants/caf�__�_��_s close by are not particularly good.",0
446,"For those looking for things to do whilst in Berlin, I would highly recommend the walking tours offered by Original Berlin Walks (Discover Berlin) and Sandemans New Berlin (Red Berlin Tour and the Free Tour).",0
447,"I would not recommend staying here,",0
448,The room - on the executive floor - could have used a good dusting.,1
449,Be sure to pick up an umbrella (for free) at the concierge if you anticipate rain while sightseeing.,0
450,you can go buy your own water and snacks.,0
451,"you might want to bring ear plugs to protect you from your neighbor's late-night television, discussions, etc. I stayed there for business and then a few days being a tourist.",0
452,"The only warning I have to offer is if you want to sleep past 8 AM, make sure you hang the do not disturb sign on your door.",0
453,This makes me not want to recommend this hotel.,0
454,I would strongly reccomend this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying there again.,0
455,but eventually need renovating.,1
456,Please read this before before booking your break away in this hotel.,0
457,"So, if you are not looking for service, unfriendly staff, basic facilities then I recommend you book this place!",0
458,"Please do not be fooled by the pictures on the internet - If you book this hotel, please expect an 'Allocation on Arrival' service as you will have no idea where you will be placed.",0
459,The hotel is very tired and is in desperate need of a refurb.,1
460,"When we booked the room the description on the website said it came with a separate seating area, despite raising the issue with reception we were basically told this was not so , I guess someone needs to amend the website.",1
461,Berlin is a top city and highly recommended for New Year!,0
462,Try out a trabi safari - it is great fun - especially in 3ft of snow in a car with no heating......................,0
463,but the whole place is in serious need of a refurbishment.,1
464,Beware of smoking areas for people having breakfast that are very close to non-smoking.,0
465,If you do not expect any kind of service whatsoever then go ahead and book these hotels but be sure what you are getting as they also have a third old building across the street which is a little more convenient than having to drag luggage three long blocks,0
466,if you're looking for a high end hotel i suggest you go somewhere else.,0
467,Especially good for shopping on the Kurfustendamm...bring an extra bag!!,0
468,I would not recommend the restaurant either the food in not good quality,0
469,This hotel is badly in need of a manager who knows what is going on in the place.,1
470,"Negatives: Bed (if you are used to Sofitel beds from around there world don't stay here), bedding (old polyester), house keeping (on both morning the room was not properly cleaned and coffee and toiletry supplies were not replenished; the room was also not very clean with huge stains on the curtains), in room equipment (if you love 70s retro you will love the TV in the room).",1
471,"This hotel should not be allowed to call itself a Sofitel as the rooms are well below standard, the staff however are right up there.",1
472,you really want a room at the back of the hotel rather than at the front.,0
473,I do wish that the staff were more accomodating.,1
474,If you prefer an outside room ask for one on an upper floor facing towards Berlin Catherdral only some 100 yards away.,0
475,and they should send the staff on a training course in customer relations.,1
476,Try and find a web deal (I booked via Hotel[-]): during Summer rooms can be booked for as low as 59 euro (and that includes breakfast).,0
477,I would advise getting an inclusive deal or eating at one of the many local cafes which offered breakfast for a third of the price.,0
478,I most warn everybody to avoid this hotel.,0
479,I really advice the hotel,1
480,but some of the staff behind reception need a few lessons in customer service (ie.,1
481,a smile or even some acknowledgment when handing in keys wouldn't go amiss).,1
482,but for those on a budget and do not mind relinquishing some comforts then this hotel is fine.,0
483,I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I liked.,0
484,If you are STILL temped to stay at this place: TAKE VERY GOOD EAR PLUGS.,0
485,DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!,0
486,and in my oppinion a hostel would be better than wasting your money on a somewhat dodgy three stars.,0
487,"If you are a espresso lover, well this is for you.",0
488,But given the price I would recommend this one unreservedly.,0
489,The hotel should give a password out to guests that check-in or at least program a time-out to avoid this frustrating situation.,1
490,"for the standard they boast, you are better off staying in a lesser star establishment where you will get better service.",0
491,"at bar called vang gogh the owner play piano.....try the dada falafel at oranien str, and cafe einstein.",0
492,Just hope that you get there to get a room ahead of someone else!,0
493,Beware: some rooms are very small and outdated,1
494,My recommendation: Save your money!,0
495,There are several better hotels nearby who appreciate your business and will work with you.,0
496,Take my advise: spend your well earned money at King's Motel (1/2 block away) or at the Sheraton or Weston.,0
497,"If you book a room, ask for a space needle view--I stayed on the 6th floor in a corner room and had a nice view.",0
498,"If you don't mind walking, you are only a couple blocks from Westlake shopping center and a few blocks from Pike's Marketplace.",0
499,I felt relaxed and comfortable there--I recommend it.,0
500,"and we had a balcony and a great view of the Space Needle (I'd recommend asking for a space needle view, if you book).",0
501,though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed.,0
502,"If you're going to Seattle, look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.",0
503,The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it.,1
504,Parking at $30 per day is an outrage but possibly standard for downtown (you can find street parking on the weekend to save a few dollars).,1
505,"Overall, I would not recommend this hotel.",0
506,although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains.,1
507,This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep,0
508,If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.,0
509,"As other reviewers have mentioned, however, street noise is a factor to be considered.",0
510,"Most importantly, if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access, BEWARE.",0
511,"Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.",0
512,This is not a hotel I can recommend for any type of group.,0
513,"If this is your preference, be advised that the balconies are barely wide enough to fit a human.",0
514,"Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor.",0
515,"However, if you avoid the second floor rooms and don't mind a little construction noise,",0
516,Go somewhere with better service.,0
517,"It wasn't just us, so beware, if you book at the Warwick, you will eventually get a beautiful room hopefully, but may need to deal with some not-so-nice staff to get it.",0
518,but we could never figure out how that worked (do some research before you go!!).,0
519,but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel (pricey but fabulous).,0
520,"I would recommend the Warwick to someone looking for a reasonable priced hotel,",0
521,but don't expect too much.,0
