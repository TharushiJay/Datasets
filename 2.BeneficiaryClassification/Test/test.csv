1,"If you do end up here, be sure to specify a room at the back of the hotel.",0
2,and I was woken by the early morning firing up of the local bus service (a courtyard-facing room is essential unless you have industrial strength earplugs.)The rooms are small and ill-conceived.,0

7,Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned.,1
8,"Don't eat breakfast in the restaurant, too costly.",0
9,"Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros..",0
10,Look around the same area for another hotel.,0
11,"With the highest breakfast prices we've ever seen, it would have been nice to have in-room beverage stations/coffee makers like one usually finds in Westins.",1
12,"If you're looking for that famous Berlin nightlife, look elsewhere.",0
13,Avoid these rooms - it is very clear why they do not have a photograph of them on their web site.,0
14,Even with these benefits I would not recommend staying in this hotel.,0
15,Rooms needed upgrading badly (and our view was of the roof!) and a good clean!,1
16,"If you have the chance, go for the brand new Radisson, Hyatt, Marriott or Adlon.",0
17,"If you get a great rate per night, like I did using a voucher system, is OK, but otherwise stay elsewhere.",0
18,Dont go for the pictures on the starwood internet site.,0
19,My take on it is that the sewer system put in by the GDR needs to be replaced.,1
20,"Bottom line: pick another hotel, the Starwood Group has a white elephant on their hands with this smelly grand hotel.",0
21,so I really highly recommend.,0
22,Hilton - stay on executive floor (great lounge) get a room overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt (beautiful day and night).,0
23,"Anyone looking for something a little bit special should look elsewhere,",0
24,You may be well advised to try another address...,0
25,"Another comfortable chair in the room, there's one, would be a plus We only ate one breakfast here because we slept in, but its a bit expensive.",1
26,but most bathrooms are in urgent need of remodelling (the existing ones are dating back to the 60s!).,1
27,it is better to avoid the bar.,0
28,They do serve drinks upon request in the lobby and you better ask them to do so.,0
29,but a bit pricey 19euros since you can have a decent breakfest in any Kaffee in Berlin.,0
30,I do recommand Kaffee Einstein.,0
31,"If you're a non-smoker, don't stay here!",0
32,The rooms need a re-do.,1
33,You must use these or risk breaking your leg.,0
34,YOu do have to shop around on the newt to get best deal.,0
35,Definitely avoid travelling by Easyjet at weekend late evenings!,0
36,One more thing- if you want to visit the Bundestag it is a good idea to book a tour (in english) in advance.,0
37,Stayed here for a conference and would not advise it for people with other options.,0
38,"The location is okay for but for better restaurants and sight-seeing, stay closer to Postdamer Platz or Mitte.",0
39,If you go to this hotel don`t book a standard room.,0
40,but the bathroom was tired and in need of refurbishment.,1
41,I would not recommend this hotel.,0
42,"Whilst the room was indeed large, clean and functional it lacked the finishing touches that one expects from 5-star accommodation.",1
43,"The Restaurants in the hotel are okay, though if not eating in the hotel I would advise you to look further a field as the restaurants/cafï¿½__ï¿½_ï¿½ï¿½_s close by are not particularly good.",0
44,"For those looking for things to do whilst in Berlin, I would highly recommend the walking tours offered by Original Berlin Walks (Discover Berlin) and Sandemans New Berlin (Red Berlin Tour and the Free Tour).",0
45,"I would not recommend staying here,",0
46,The room - on the executive floor - could have used a good dusting.,1
47,Be sure to pick up an umbrella (for free) at the concierge if you anticipate rain while sightseeing.,0
48,you can go buy your own water and snacks.,0
49,"you might want to bring ear plugs to protect you from your neighbor's late-night television, discussions, etc. I stayed there for business and then a few days being a tourist.",0
50,"The only warning I have to offer is if you want to sleep past 8 AM, make sure you hang the do not disturb sign on your door.",0
51,This makes me not want to recommend this hotel.,0
52,I would strongly reccomend this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying there again.,0
53,but eventually need renovating.,1
54,Please read this before before booking your break away in this hotel.,0
55,"So, if you are not looking for service, unfriendly staff, basic facilities then I recommend you book this place!",0
56,"Please do not be fooled by the pictures on the internet - If you book this hotel, please expect an 'Allocation on Arrival' service as you will have no idea where you will be placed.",0
57,The hotel is very tired and is in desperate need of a refurb.,1
58,"When we booked the room the description on the website said it came with a separate seating area, despite raising the issue with reception we were basically told this was not so , I guess someone needs to amend the website.",0
59,Berlin is a top city and highly recommended for New Year!,0
60,Try out a trabi safari - it is great fun - especially in 3ft of snow in a car with no heating......................,0
61,but the whole place is in serious need of a refurbishment.,1
62,Beware of smoking areas for people having breakfast that are very close to non-smoking.,0
63,If you do not expect any kind of service whatsoever then go ahead and book these hotels but be sure what you are getting as they also have a third old building across the street which is a little more convenient than having to drag luggage three long blocks,0
64,if you're looking for a high end hotel i suggest you go somewhere else.,0
65,Especially good for shopping on the Kurfustendamm...bring an extra bag!!,0
66,I would not recommend the restaurant either the food in not good quality,0
67,This hotel is badly in need of a manager who knows what is going on in the place.,1
68,"Negatives: Bed (if you are used to Sofitel beds from around there world don't stay here), bedding (old polyester), house keeping (on both morning the room was not properly cleaned and coffee and toiletry supplies were not replenished; the room was also not very clean with huge stains on the curtains), in room equipment (if you love 70s retro you will love the TV in the room).",1
69,"This hotel should not be allowed to call itself a Sofitel as the rooms are well below standard, the staff however are right up there.",1
70,you really want a room at the back of the hotel rather than at the front.,0
71,I do wish that the staff were more accomodating.,1
72,If you prefer an outside room ask for one on an upper floor facing towards Berlin Catherdral only some 100 yards away.,0
73,and they should send the staff on a training course in customer relations.,1
74,Try and find a web deal (I booked via Hotel[-]): during Summer rooms can be booked for as low as 59 euro (and that includes breakfast).,0
75,I would advise getting an inclusive deal or eating at one of the many local cafes which offered breakfast for a third of the price.,0
76,I most warn everybody to avoid this hotel.,0
77,I really advice the hotel,0
78,but some of the staff behind reception need a few lessons in customer service (ie.,1
79,a smile or even some acknowledgment when handing in keys wouldn't go amiss).,1
80,but for those on a budget and do not mind relinquishing some comforts then this hotel is fine.,0
81,I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I liked.,0
82,If you are STILL temped to stay at this place: TAKE VERY GOOD EAR PLUGS.,0
83,DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!,0
84,and in my oppinion a hostel would be better than wasting your money on a somewhat dodgy three stars.,0
85,"If you are a espresso lover, well this is for you.",0
86,But given the price I would recommend this one unreservedly.,0
87,The hotel should give a password out to guests that check-in or at least program a time-out to avoid this frustrating situation.,1
88,"for the standard they boast, you are better off staying in a lesser star establishment where you will get better service.",0
89,"at bar called vang gogh the owner play piano.....try the dada falafel at oranien str, and cafe einstein.",0
90,Just hope that you get there to get a room ahead of someone else!,0
91,Beware: some rooms are very small and outdated,0
92,My recommendation: Save your money!,0
93,There are several better hotels nearby who appreciate your business and will work with you.,0
94,Take my advise: spend your well earned money at King's Motel (1/2 block away) or at the Sheraton or Weston.,0
95,"If you book a room, ask for a space needle view--I stayed on the 6th floor in a corner room and had a nice view.",0
96,"If you don't mind walking, you are only a couple blocks from Westlake shopping center and a few blocks from Pike's Marketplace.",0
97,I felt relaxed and comfortable there--I recommend it.,0
98,"and we had a balcony and a great view of the Space Needle (I'd recommend asking for a space needle view, if you book).",0
99,though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed.,0
100,"If you're going to Seattle, look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.",0
101,The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it.,0
102,Parking at $30 per day is an outrage but possibly standard for downtown (you can find street parking on the weekend to save a few dollars).,0
103,"Overall, I would not recommend this hotel.",0
104,although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains.,0
105,This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep,0
106,If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.,0
107,"As other reviewers have mentioned, however, street noise is a factor to be considered.",0
108,"Most importantly, if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access, BEWARE.",0
109,"Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.",0
110,This is not a hotel I can recommend for any type of group.,0
111,"If this is your preference, be advised that the balconies are barely wide enough to fit a human.",0
112,"Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor.",0
113,"However, if you avoid the second floor rooms and don't mind a little construction noise,",0
114,Go somewhere with better service.,0
115,"It wasn't just us, so beware, if you book at the Warwick, you will eventually get a beautiful room hopefully, but may need to deal with some not-so-nice staff to get it.",0
116,but we could never figure out how that worked (do some research before you go!!).,0
117,but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel (pricey but fabulous).,0
118,"I would recommend the Warwick to someone looking for a reasonable priced hotel,",0
119,but don't expect too much.,0
120,"Beware, if you use the Grayline for transportation, allow plenty of time, as they ran up to an hour late.",0
121,"However, there is a good advantage to this hotel if you have a car.",0
122,You can park your car yourself and save money doing without valet service.,0
123,Parking was expensive and there was no elevator in the parkade so if you have any mobility problems you need to use the valet parking.,0
124,Suggestions: Woodland Park Zoo (fantastic and worth the 10 minute bus drive out of downtown); Anthony's Pier 66 (excellent seafood restaurant on the waterfront) Enjoy your stay at the Moore!,0
125,Rooms do not appear to have any functioning heating or built in fan/cooler/heaters which is a bit of a drawback depending on when you visit.,1
126,Travellers considering staying at the mediocre Hostelling International Seattle should seriously consider staying at the Moore instead.,0
127,and the price virtually the same if you were considering a private room at HI.,0
128,Request a 6th or 7th floor room facing the water and you'll enjoy a view that most visitors pay through the nose for.,0
129,"Walk to Pike Place in the morning, shopping at Pioneer Square in the afternoon, visit nearby Belltown at night.",0
130,Walk everywhere.,0
131,They'll hold your luggage for you either before your check-in time or after you've checked out but have a few hours to kill before catching your flight.,0
132,"Visiting the convention center - it's less than 10 minutes walk, grab coffee at the French Bakery at Pike's Place before you head into convention hell.",0
133,there are two lots on either side of the hotel or try the Bon/Macy's parking lot for something a bit cheaper.,0
134,"Oh, and they like to keep your key at the front desk - there is only ONE KEY available per room, so if you're sharing with someone but have different itineraries, make a habit of dropping the key off at the front desk.",0
135,Give this place a go - just catch up on sleepbefore you do.,0
136,so you don't have to walk if you don't want to.,0
137,5h on  a platform to look down  Really: NOT TO DO - the bar in the Moore: rough.,0
138,"My suggestion to anyone considering the Moore: If you want the low price, stay outside of DT since you will have to pay for parking anyways, or break the bank and stay at a nicer place!",0
139,and I've got to say that it was in desperate need of an update (and I'm not picky).,1
140,Make no mistake - the Moore is pretty much a dump.,0
141,Be careful of the room type if you are more than one person.,0

307,just keep your wits about you and you will have no problems.,0
308,go through the large gate and to the left is a lovely little outside bar area ___ï¿½_ï¿½___?,0
